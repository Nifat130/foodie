Flutter Public API Integration Task

 🍔 Flutter Public API Integration Task

 📱 Overview
This project is part of the **Flutter Developer Recruitment Task**.  
The goal is to build a **mobile application using Flutter** that fetches data from a public API and displays it in a **pixel-perfect design**, following best practices in **state management**, **error handling**, and **code structure**.

---

 🎯 Task Requirements
The app demonstrates:
- Fetching and displaying data from multiple public API endpoints.
- Clean and maintainable Flutter codebase.
- Responsive UI (for both **mobile** and **web**).
- Proper error handling and loading states.
- State management implementation (e.g., **GetX**, **Provider**, or **Bloc**).

---

 🧩 Features Implemented
✅ Fetch configuration data (base URLs and images)  
✅ Display banner slider
✅ Show food categories 
✅ Display popular foods 
✅ Display food campaigns   
✅ Show restaurant list 
✅ Implemented smooth scrolling and error-handling UI  
✅ Responsive layout for **mobile** and **web**
